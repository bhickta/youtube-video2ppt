# youtube-video2ppt

This is a command utility to create ppt from the youtube educational video. 
Specifically designed for youtube channel: `StatQuest with Josh Starmer` :heart:

I find his works amazing and I wanted to get the slides out from the video so that I can make a note for revision so I decided to write this script using openCV and shell scripting.
